# misc-code
A Python &amp; C++ repository with misc. tools, programs, etc.

---
Stuff Here:
 * Python:
     * `googlecomp.py`: A Google autocomplete script I made.
     * **OLD STUFF** (may be messy or bad code):
         * `encrypter_decrypter.py`: A cipher I made while learning Python.
     * `xkcdch.py`: A quick script to check for a new xkcd and alert the user if there is one when run
         * NOTES: Place in your home directory and add it to some login script (i.e. `.bashrc`) for best results.
 * C++:
     * (Note: All of these come with test programs. Also download the header.)
     * (All programs compile normally with `g++` unless noted otherwise.)
     * `in`: A function to test if a value is in a low-level array.
     * `circle`: A class to represent a circle.
     * `truncf`: Truncate a file to a certain length.
 * More stuff coming soon!
